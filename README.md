# Computer Science Flash Cards

This is a little website I've put together to allow me to easily make flash cards and quiz myself for memorization of:

- general cs knowledge
    - vocabulary
    - definitions of processes
    - powers of 2
    - design patterns
- code
    - data structures
    - algorithms
    - solving problems
    - bitwise operations

Will be able to use it on:
    - desktop
    - mobile (phone and tablet)

It uses:
- Python 3
- Flask
- other things I need to figure out
